                <h3>Method Steps</h3>
            <div class="cont">
                 <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add mince and cook, stirring to break up lumps, for 3 mins or until cooked through. Add pasta sauce and ½ cup (125ml) water. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 mins or until sauce thickens slightly.</p>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to the boil over high heat. Add the spaghetti and cook, stirring often, for 8 mins or until tender but still firm to the bite. Drain, reserving ½ cup (125ml) of the cooking liquid.</p>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>Add the spaghetti to the sauce and toss to coat, adding enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten mixture as needed. Season with salt and pepper. Top with parmesan and parsley.</p>
